# NotifyPropertyChangedExtensions.GetOrSetValueAsync&lt;T&gt; method (1 of 2)

Asynchronously retrieves a value and updates a backing field, calling the PropertyChanged handler when done. Allows to use lazy loading for costly operations in accessors, as follows:

```csharp
private ImageSource? image;
public ImageSource? Image 
{
    get => this.GetOrSetValueAsync(() => myAsyncMethod(), ref image, OnPropertyChanged);
    set => image = value; // Optional (and usually useless since the value is set when the getter gets called for the first time)
}
```

Note: if the getter is called multiple times while the computed value is null, the async callback will be called again. You should handle this to avoid this behavior.

```csharp
public static T? GetOrSetValueAsync<T>(this INotifyPropertyChanged src, Func<T> resolve, 
    ref T field, Action<string>? propertyChanged = null, 
    [CallerMemberName] string? propertyName = null)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| T |  |
| src |  |
| resolve |  |
| field |  |
| propertyChanged |  |
| propertyName |  |
