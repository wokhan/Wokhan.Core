# Wokhan.Core
.Net Standard (core & framework) extensions and helpers.

I've used this library for years and am still modifying it when I need something that doesn't exist in trusted libraries. There is no roadmap, no information at what I might add or not (and many function could be deprecated if someone comes up with something better, which will probably happen one day or another ðŸ˜…).

# Documentation 
Please check [the generated documentation](docs/generated/Wokhan.Core.md) to get a glimpse at what this library does.

# Note
Tests are almost empty and should be improved.
