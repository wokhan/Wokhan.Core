# 🗃️ Description
.Net Standard (core & framework) extensions and helpers.

I've used this library for years and am still modifying it when I need something that doesn't exist in trusted libraries. There is no roadmap, no information at what I might add or not (and many function could be deprecated if someone comes up with something better, which will probably happen one day or another 😅).

# 🗄️ Release

The library is available on Nuget.

# 📒 Documentation 
Please check [the generated documentation](docs/generated/Wokhan.Core.md) to get a glimpse at what this library does.

# 📃 Note
Tests are almost empty and should be improved.
